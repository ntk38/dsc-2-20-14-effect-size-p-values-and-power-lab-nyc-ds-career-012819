    "It's time to practice your skills regarding effect size, p-values and the power of statistical tests. You'll put all of these ideas together to investigate the design of a statistical experiment for a political campaign.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Describe how effect size, sample size and p_value are related to each other. \n",
    "* Use Welch's t-test for distributions that do not have a normality assumption.\n",
    "* Plot visualisations to confirm the calculations and intuitions towards p_value and effect size. \n",
    "* Explain how with a same effect size, we may see different p_values with increasing number of simulations. "

    "\n",
    "*\"56% of likely voters prefer candidate A with a **margin of 4 points**. *\n",
    "\n",
    "we also learnt that the uncertainty from sampling erros errors can be reduced by repeating the experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "For reporting uncertainty, we used hypothesis testing to compare experimental results with the null hypothesis that the results don't exist. This is done because we know that due to random errors, we might see a positive experimental result, *even if no true effect exists*.  Following this thought, The p-value is at the heart of a massive controversy in scientific community with some journals banning hypothesis testing completely. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we shall try to see this phenomenon in action. You would be required to use your existing statistical analysis and plotting abilities to visualise the effect of sample size and effect size on p-value calculation.\n"

    "\n",
    "Suppose you are running clinical tests for a new pharmaceutical drug. In such a situation, you would create a control (placebo) group and a treatment group for running independant t-test. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine that your results show the drug has some effect - it lowers the blood pressure for participants in the treatment group. To address uncertainty, you could ask a question like:\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"What is the probability I would see this effect due to random fluctuations if there was actually no effect?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, the Null hypothesis would look like: $μc=μt$. We can also create one-sided alternative hypothesis accordingly, as we saw earlier. \n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of this question leads to p-value calculation using some test statistic to calculate the probability you would see an equal or greater effect under the null hypothesis. We know that when p-value is below some critical value, typically p<0.05, then the result is declared statistically significant and the null hypothesis is rejected."
